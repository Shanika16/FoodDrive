# FoodDrive

Overview:
The Food Drive app is a community-centric platform created to streamline and amplify the impact of our collective efforts in combating food insecurity. It acts as a central hub for information, participation, and contribution to our ongoing food drive campaigns.

Why I Created It:
The primary motivation behind creating this app was to address the prevalent issue of food scarcity and hunger within our community. Witnessing the struggles faced by individuals and families grappling with food insecurity sparked the need for a more organized, accessible, and engaging solution to support their nutritional needs.

Problem Addressed:
The app addresses the critical problem of food insecurity, where many individuals and families lack consistent access to nutritious meals. It aims to bridge the gap between surplus resources and those in need by providing a platform that encourages donations, volunteerism, and community participation in regular food drives.
